# User-ACL-fastcheck

Funct 1 : Gui for get the user's most important details in sec, password realted attrs, email, grid-view for ad groups.
Funct 2 : retrives the directory ACLs 
Funct 3 /not yet introduced/ : check if the user is the member of the group


Saves some time working on regular service desk task.
AD agent just like checking the ACL of shares by clicking is too slow.
